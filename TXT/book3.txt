Title: Cinderella

Author: Charles Perrault

Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Cinderella. She lived with her wicked stepmother and two stepsisters, who treated her very badly. One day, an invitation to the annual royal ball arrived, and Cinderella's stepmother refused to let her go.

Cinderella was very sad. Suddenly, her Fairy Godmother appeared and turned Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown! She also turned a pumpkin into a carriage and some mice into horses. But she warned Cinderella to return before midnight when the spells would wear off.

At the ball, Cinderella charmed the Prince but had to leave suddenly as the clock struck midnight. As she ran, she left behind one glass slipper on the staircase of the palace. The Prince, determined to find the mysterious girl, began a quest to find the owner of the slipper.

After visiting every house in the kingdom, the Prince arrived at Cinderella's home. Despite the stepmother's efforts to hide her, Cinderella tried on the slipper, which fit perfectly. Recognizing her as the woman he had fallen in love with at the ball, the Prince asked Cinderella to marry him, and they lived happily ever after.
