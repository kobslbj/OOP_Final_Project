type: Fairy Tale
Title: Sleeping Beauty

Author: Brothers Grimm

Once upon a time, there was a king and queen who longed for a child. Finally, their wish was granted, and they had a beautiful girl. They held a grand celebration and invited all the fairies in the land, except for one who had been overlooked.

During the celebration, the fairies bestowed gifts of beauty, intelligence, and grace upon the baby. However, the overlooked fairy, angry at not being invited, cursed the princess, proclaiming that on her sixteenth birthday, she would prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die.

A kind fairy, who had not yet given her gift, softened the curse. Instead of dying, the princess would fall into a deep sleep that could only be broken by true love's kiss.

Years passed, and on her sixteenth birthday, the princess stumbled upon an old woman spinning in a tower. Curious, she touched the spindle and instantly fell into a deep sleep, as the curse foretold. The whole castle fell asleep with her.

After many years, a prince who heard stories of the sleeping princess found the castle. He fought his way through the overgrown thicket and reached the princess. Moved by her serene beauty, he kissed her, breaking the curse.

The princess awoke, and with her, the entire castle came to life. The prince and princess soon married, and the kingdom celebrated their happiness.
